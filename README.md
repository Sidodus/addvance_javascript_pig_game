# GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- Players are not allowed to skip turn.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND Score
- BUT, if the player rolls 1, all his ROUND Score gets lost. After which, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL Score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 50 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
